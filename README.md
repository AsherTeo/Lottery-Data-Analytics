## Overview
Welcome to the lottery data analysis project focusing on Toto, a popular lottery game in Singapore. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into the patterns and trends present in Toto draws over certain years. Specifically, we aim to identify 'hot' and 'cold' numbers, explore how often numbers from the previous draw reappear in subsequent draws and many more. 

The data is extracted from the official Singapore Pools website using `Selenium`, a web scraping tool. Then, we preprocess the data to extract relevant features such as winning numbers, draw dates, and additional information. We utilize **Python**, along with libraries such as `Pandas` and `Seaborn`, to conduct our analysis and gain insights from the Toto data. Pandas is used for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, allowing us to efficiently handle and organize the lottery data. Seaborn, on the other hand, is employed for data visualization, enabling us to create informative plots and charts to visualize lottery patterns and trends.
