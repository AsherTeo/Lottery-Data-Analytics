## Overview
Welcome to the lottery data analysis project focusing on Toto, a popular lottery game in Singapore. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into the patterns and trends present in Toto draws over certain years. Specifically, we aim to identify 'hot' and 'cold' numbers, explore how often numbers from the previous draw reappear in subsequent draws, determine the likelihood of consecutive numbers (e.g., 12 and 13) appearing together in winning combinations, and investigate whether the sum, average, and standard deviation of Toto values influence the chances of winning the jackpot.
