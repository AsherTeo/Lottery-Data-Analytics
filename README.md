## Overview
Welcome to the lottery data analysis project focusing on Toto, a popular lottery game in Singapore. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into the patterns and trends present in Toto draws over certain years. Specifically, we aim to identify 'hot' and 'cold' numbers, explore how often numbers from the previous draw reappear in subsequent draws and many more. 

The data is extracted from the official Singapore Pools [website](https://www.singaporepools.com.sg/en/product/Pages/toto_results.aspx) using `Selenium`, a web scraping tool. Then, we preprocess the data to extract relevant features such as winning numbers, draw dates, and additional information. We utilize **Python**, along with libraries such as `Pandas` and `Seaborn`, to conduct our analysis and gain insights from the Toto data. 

Additionally, we've enhanced our analysis by building an interactive dashboard using **Power BI**. This dashboard provides a fun and engaging way for our audience to interact with the Toto data, similar to the experience of being in a casino. Inspired by casino games like roulette, where players can view statistics on red and black winning rates or the last 10 numbers, our dashboard offers dynamic visualizations and statistics on Toto draws. It allows users to explore trends, patterns, and insights in an interactive and entertaining manner.

## Objective

1) Identify "hot" and "cold" numbers: Analyze historical data to determine which numbers have appeared most frequently (hot numbers) and least frequently (cold numbers) in past draws.
2) Frequency of numbers from the previous draw in subsequent draws: Quantify how often numbers from the previous draw are repeated in subsequent draws, exploring any patterns or trends in their recurrence.
3) Consecutive number occurrence in winning combinations: Investigate whether consecutive numbers, such as 12 and 13, are more or less likely to appear together in winning combinations compared to non-consecutive numbers.
4) Patterns of number selection: Explore whether certain numbers tend to be selected together more frequently than others, indicating potential patterns or strategies used by players.
5) Balance of odd and even or high and low numbers: Analyze the distribution of odd and even numbers, as well as high and low numbers, in winning sets to determine if there are any biases or patterns in their occurrence.
6) Relationship between Toto values and jackpot chances: Investigate whether specific characteristics of Toto values, such as smaller or larger sums, averages, and standard deviations, are associated with an increased likelihood of winning the jackpot.
7) Mean gap and jackpot likelihood: Examine if a smaller mean gap between numbers in winning combinations is linked to a higher chance of winning the jackpot, indicating potential strategies for number selection.
8) Temporal analysis of winners: Determine which years, months, and days of the week have historically had the highest total number of winners, identifying any temporal patterns or trends.
9) Seasonal variations in winning numbers: Investigate whether there are any seasonal trends or variations in the frequency of winning numbers, considering factors such as holidays or changes in player behavior.
10) Correlation among winning numbers: Explore if winning numbers exhibit any correlations or tendencies to appear together more frequently than expected by chance, indicating potential patterns in number selection or drawing mechanisms.
